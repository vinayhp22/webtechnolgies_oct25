    Humans:
    Skeleton(Structure of the body) - HTML(Structure)
    Clothes/Makeup - CSS(Styling)
    Nervous System or Musles - JS(actions or movements)

    HTML - gives structure to webpage
    CSS - gives styling to webpage
    JS - gives behaviour(how to react for user actions)

    <h1>Javascript (JS) is high level, interpreted, scripting language that runs on the browser.</h1>
    <p>ReactJS, AngularJS, VueJS, NodeJS(for both backend as well as frontend) etc..</p>

    <p>JS was created by Brenden Eich in 1995 while working at Netscape.</p>

    <h4>Why JS is important in webpages:</h4>
    <p>1. Form Validations - if user give wrong input I should validate in frontend </p>
        1st layer - frontend 
        2nd layer - backend
        3rd layer - database
        In all 3 layers we need to validations. To avoid server traffic, we need to check using JS.
    
    <p>2.  Interactive Elements</p>
        Menus, Dropdowns, Carosels(sliders), image galleries, FAQ's - Accordions

    <p>3. Handling User Events</p>
        <p>JS listens to events like click, hover, keydown, submit etc</p>
        <p>Ex: A search bar that results as we type.</p>

    <p>4. Dynamic content Change</p>
        <p>Content changes without reloading the webpage.</p>
        <p>chatting(Whatsapp Web), live cricket scores, stock market updates etc</p>
        <p>This is done by AJAX or Fetch API</p>

    <p>5. Enhancing user experiance:</p>
        <p>Animations, smooth transitions, progess bar..</p>
