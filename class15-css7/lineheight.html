    <h1>Line-height : spacing between two lines</h1>
    <p>It is unitless, but it <b>multiplies with font size</b>.</p>
    <p>This is applied only for texts, not for images or other elements</p>

    <p class="lh10">lh10 - This is P tag with line-height 10 where font size is 18px, so total height of this element is 180px only if it is in single line.</p>
    <p class="lh1">lh1 - This is P tag with line-height 1 where font-size is 36px, so total height of this element is 36px only if it is in single line</p>
    <p class="lh2">lh2 - This is P tag with line-height 1 where font-size is un defined for this tag, so total height of this element is 32px, 
        i.e multiplied with root element (html tag)'s default size of 16px only if it is in single line</p>

    <p><b>Note:</b> If lines increses, total height of the element also increses.</p>
    <p class="lh2">if this is in single line then total height would be 32px</p>
    <p class="lh2">if this is in 2 lines then total height would be 64px</p>
    <p class="lh2">if this is in 3 lines then total height would be 96px</p>
    <p class="lh2">if this is in 4 lines then total height would be 128px</p>
